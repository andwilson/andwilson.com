# Josh Meets Computer
## Josh Zastrow's personal space on the web

This site is built using Gatsby static site generator and is hosted on Netlify.  This makes it easy to easily add content to the site with markdown and automatically trigger new builds when pushed to this repository.  Markdown supports images, syntax highlighting, iframes, and even custom React components.  Links are automatically added with each markdown post, using frontmatter to filter and sort appropriately.
