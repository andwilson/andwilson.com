# &Wilson
## Andrew Wilson's personal portfolio, notes, and consulting website

This site is built using Gatsby static site generator and is hosted on Netlify.  This makes it easy to easily add content to the site with markdown and automatically trigger new builds when pushed to this repository.  Markdown supports images, syntax highlighting, iframes, and even custom React components.  Links and routes are automatically added with each new markdown post, using frontmatter to filter and sort appropriately.
